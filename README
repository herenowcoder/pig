pig = ports indexing graph

==========================

This is a resurrection of a good old idea of totally speeding up
macports on old (think G4) computers. This time it will be done in a
completely unexpected yet logically most viable language.

The ideas & solutions exploited here may be outstandingly usable in
any package manager for any distribution of a large codebase.


The current status is that parser can handle original ports index but with
multilines converted to single lines.


Stay tuned.
